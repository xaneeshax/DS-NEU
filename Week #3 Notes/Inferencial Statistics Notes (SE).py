'''
z-scores:
 - Interpretation of the scores is independant of the mean
 z = (x - x hat) / SD

Goal of Statistics:
Use sample data to generalize about the population


Defining Probability:
The likelihood that a random event is going to happen


P(E) = 1 - P'(E)

Defining Probability:
The ratio of the number of desirable outcomes to the total
number of possible outcomes, provided all outcomes are
equally likely

probability of A = # of outcomes classified as A / total # of possible outcomes

Random Sampling: A process or procedure used to draw samples

- Each data point in the population has an equal chance of being selected
- Probability of being selected stays constant from one selection to the next
- Requires sampling with replacement

# Probability and Probability Distributions:

'''
Standard Error:

Sampling Error: the discrepancy, or amount of error, that exists between a sample
statistic and the corresponding population parameter

Variability of a distribution of scores is measured by the
standard deviation of the scores

Variability of a distribution of sample means
is measured by the standard deviation of the sample means

STANDARD ERROR: THE SD OF SAMPLE MEANS
- measure of how much the distance is expected on average between
  a sample mean and a population mean

FORMULA:

SE = s / sqrt(n) where s is the sd of the sample means

SE tells us the average distance between the mean score from the sample
and the mean score from all the students in the population


Causality:
- We establish causality through an experiment

A True Experiment:
Must demonstrate that changes in one variable are directly responsible
for causing changes in the second variable

# 4 Basic Components of an Experiment:

'''
1. Manipulation : changing its value to create 2 or more treatment conditions
2. Measurement : set of scores in the treatment condition
3. Comparision : the scores from each treatment condition are compared
4. Control : All other variables are controlled

Independant Variable:
The variable that is manipulated by the researcher

Dependant Variable:
The variable that is measured in each of the treatment conditions

Extraneous Variable:
All other variables not including IV and DV

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
Between subject:
a separte group of participants
is assigned to each of the conditions

Within subject:
Same group of individuals participate in ever IV
study repeats measurements of teh same individuals under diff conditions
(Often called a repeated-measures design)
