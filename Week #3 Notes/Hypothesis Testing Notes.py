Hypothesis:
- A statement that describes or explains a relationship between variables
- Identifies the specific variables involved and describes how they are related

A Hypothesis Test:
- A systematic procedure that determines whether the sample data
provides convincing evidence to support the original hypothesis

# Elements of a Hypothesis Test

'''
1. Null Hypothesis
H1: States there is a difference, effect, change or relationship
H0 (Null) : There is no identifiable difference between the two variables

2. Sample Statistic
Aggregation of the sum of our values

3. Standard Error
Estimating the value of the parameter in a population

4. Test Statistic
- A summary value that measures the degree to which the sample data
are in accordance with the null hypothesis
- Compare the sample statistic with the null hypothesis using the SE as baseline

Test Statistic = (Sample Statistic - Parameter from Null) / Standard Error

aka Actual Difference / Difference expected by chance

5. Alpha Level (Level of Significance)
- Provides a criterion for interpreting the test statistic
- Maximum probability that the result is caused by chance
- If your p value if smaller than the alpha value , then your result is significant

Type 1 Error:
Mistake of rejecting a null hyp that's true - should not be rejected
Prob of Type 1 is the p value

Type 2 Error:
Mistake of not rejecting null hypothesis that is really false - should be rejected
